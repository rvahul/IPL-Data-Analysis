# IPL-Data-Analysis
📊 IPL Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard Project
🔍 Project Title:
"Comprehensive Analytics and Visualization of IPL Data using Python and Interactive Dashboards"

🎯 Objective:
Analyze IPL match and player data to extract key insights on team performance, player rankings, toss/venue impacts, and win prediction trends. Present findings through an interactive dashboard using Python tools.

📁 Dataset:
You can use publicly available IPL datasets from sources like Kaggle, such as:

matches.csv – Match results and metadata.

deliveries.csv – Ball-by-ball delivery data.

🛠 Tools & Libraries:
Python

Pandas / NumPy – Data preprocessing & manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly – Data visualization

Streamlit / Dash / Tableau / Power BI – Interactive dashboard

Scikit-learn – For trend analysis and prediction modeling

📌 Key Tasks (Based on Your Image):
1. Match & Team Performance Analysis
Track each team’s season performance.

Win/loss ratio, consistency, net run rate.

Highlight dominant teams per season.

2. Player Statistics & Rankings
Top run-scorers, wicket-takers, strike rates.

Overall MVP-style rankings using weighted scores.

3. Venue & Toss Impact Study
Win percentage by stadium.

Does winning the toss correlate with winning the match?

4. Head-to-Head Comparisons
Compare performance metrics between two selected teams.

Batting, bowling averages, and previous encounters.

5. Win Prediction & Trend Analysis
Use ML models (like logistic regression or random forest) to predict match outcomes.

Analyze features like toss result, team form, venue, and player stats.

6. Interactive Visualizations & Dashboards
Filters: Season, team, player, venue

Graphs: Bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, pie charts

Components: Match summary, top players, comparative stats

📊 Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebook / Python Script with all analysis & model code.

Interactive Dashboard using Streamlit/Dash/Tableau.

Report / Presentation summarizing findings, insights, and future recommendations.

🧠 Learning Outcomes:
End-to-end data analytics project workflow.

Real-world data wrangling, EDA, visualization, and ML.

Dashboard creation and storytelling using data.
